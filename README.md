-this is a submission I made for the coding challange portion of the Insight Data Engineering Program. -


I was not able to complete the challenge as assigned, but am still proud of the effort I put in.

Tried using list comprehension to populate Python Dictionaries, but the data got very complicated and I wasn't able to wrangle it as needed, so I decided to use simple nested if statments in a for loop and write into a new CSV file

I am aware that the complaint and company counters may be off, and I would love to discuss paths to improvement with program directors and assignment graders.

I also know that the original complaints.csv file is not in this repository. I tried to push it but the file limit excees GitHub's size limit. Even after using Git Large File Storage (LFS) this was the case.
