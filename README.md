I was not able to complete the challenge as assigned, but am still proud of the effort I put in.

Tried using list comprehension to populate Python Dictionaries, but the data got very complicated and I wasn't able to wrangle it as needed, so I decided to use simple nested if statments in a for loop and write into a new CSV file

I am aware that the complaint and company counters may be off, and I would love to discuss paths to improvement with program directors and assignment graders.
